        <h1>
            Kim Dynasty
        </h1>

        <p>Since the founding of the nation, North Korea's supreme leadership has stayed within the Kim family, which in North Korea is referred to as the Mount Paektu Bloodline. <br> It is a three-generation lineage descending from the country's first leader, Kim Il-sung.
             Kim Il-sung developed North Korea around the Juche ideology, and stayed in power until his death. <br>
             Kim developed a cult of personality closely tied to the state philosophy of Juche, which was later passed on to his successors: his son Kim Jong-il in 1994 and grandson Kim Jong-un in 2011. <br>
             In 2013, Clause 2 of Article 10 of the newly edited Ten Fundamental Principles of the Korean Workers' Party stated that the party and revolution must be carried "eternally" by the "Mount Paektu Bloodline".</p>
